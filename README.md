# smartcontract-benchmark
We create an annotated dataset with 110 contract test cases. These 110 cases are divided into 11 subdatasets, with 10 subdatasets containing know vulnerabilities corresponding to the Top 10 categories and one correct subdataset. These contracts involve different code size and a wide range of applications.

## Top 10 categories:
1. Reentrancy
2. Arithmetic
3. Gasless send
4. unsafe suicidal
5. unsafe delegatecall
6. unchecked send
7. TOD
8. time manipulation
9. tx.origin
10. bad randomness
